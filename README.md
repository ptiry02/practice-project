# Making a Dummy food order web app with React

This is a practice project following a Udemy course to learn react.

I followed the course steps allthough I did it a little different to give it my own style.

You can find the original example in: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/11-practice-food-order-app to compare.
